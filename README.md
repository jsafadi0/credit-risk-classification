# credit-risk-classification
1- An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to train a model using our machine learning skills to identify if the borrowers are creditworthy or not. I builit two models and used two methods: LogisticRegression and RandomOverSampler in each of these models.
2- The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
My results for LogisitcRegression models are printed out below cell 22. My results for RandomOverSampler models are printed out below cell 36.
3- A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
I noticed that RandomOverSampler is a better model to use and recommend by the company. And the reason being is RandomOverSampler model performs better because it has the ability to detect more people who are more likely to default on their loans and that's the goal of our code in analyzing the problem. Thus, RandomOverSampler is my recommendation for the problem
